Asynchronous and Parallel Programming in C# (Hands-On Labs)
============================

Lab Requirements  
----------------

* You must provide your own laptop computer (Windows or Mac) for this hands-on lab.  

* You need to have the .NET 6 SDK installed as well as the code editor of your choice (Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or Visual Studio Code are both good (free) choices).

* Interactive labs, web application samples, and console samples will work with Windows, macOS, and Linux (anywhere .NET 6 will run).  

Links:

* .NET 6.0 SDK

Lab Descriptions  
----------------
The "Labs" folder contains hands-on labs. The labs are integrated throughout the workshop day.    

* [Lab 01 - Recommended Practices and Continuations](./Lab01/)
* [Lab 02 - Unit Testing Asynchronous Methods](./Lab02/)
* [Lab 03 - Adding Async to an Existing Application](./Lab03/)
* [Lab 04 - Working with AggregateException](./Lab04/) -- **OPTIONAL**
* [Lab 05 - Parallel Practices](./Lab05/)


Each lab consists of the following:

* **Labxx-Instructions** (Markdown)  
A markdown file containing the lab instructions. This includes the scenario, a set of goals, and step-by-step instructions.  
This can be viewed on GitHub or in Visual Studio Code (just click the "Open Preview to the Side" button in the upper right corner).

* **Starter** (Folder)  
This folder contains the starting code for the lab.

* **Completed** (Folder)  
This folder contains the completed solution. If at any time, you get stuck during the lab, you can check this folder for a solution.
