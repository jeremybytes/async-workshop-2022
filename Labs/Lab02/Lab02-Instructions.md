Lab 02 - Unit Testing Asynchronous Methods
================================================

Objectives
-----------
This lab shows some techniques to unit test asynchronous code, including writing async tests and creating asynchronous fake objects.

Application Overview
---------------------

The "Starter" folder contains the code files for this lab. 

**Visual Studio 2022:** Open the "DataProcessor.sln" solution.  
**Visual Studio Code:** Open the "Starter" folder in VS Code.  

*Note: The lab also contains a "Completed" folder with the finished solution. If you get stuck along the way or have issues with debugging, take a look at the code in the "Completed" folder for guidance.*

This solution is a console application that processes data from a text file. For details on the application, please refer to the "Overview" and "Current Classes" section of Lab 01.

The "DataProcessor.Library.Tests" project contains existing tests. These use MSTest as the testing framework. Run the tests as follows:

**Visual Studio Code**  
For Visual Studio Code, we'll run the tests from the command line. (This is the most consistent experience. If you use Visual Studio Code full time, you will want to find a plug-in for your specific test framework.)

Here's one way to get to the right folder in Windows. In File Explorer, open the folder that contains the test project: *[working_directory]/DataProcessor.Library.Tests/*. Right click on an empty space in the folder and choose "Open in Terminal" or "Open in PowerShell". This will give you a prompt to the correct location.

```
PS C:\Lab02\Starter\DataProcessor.Library.Tests>
```

From here, type "dotnet test" to run the unit tests.

```
PS C:\Lab02\Starter\DataProcessor.Library.Tests> dotnet test
```

You should get output similar to the following:

```
Starting test execution, please wait...
A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.
  Skipped ParseData_WithMixedData_ReturnsGoodRecords [17 ms]
  Skipped ParseData_WithGoodRecord_ReturnsOneRecord [< 1 ms]
  Skipped ParseData_WithBadRecord_ReturnsZeroRecords [< 1 ms]
  Skipped ParseData_WithBadStartDate_ReturnsZeroRecords [< 1 ms]
  Skipped ParseData_WithBadRating_ReturnsZeroRecords [< 1 ms]

Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     4, Skipped:     5, Total:     9, Duration: 248 ms - DataProcessor.Library.Tests.dll (net6.0)
```

This shows a total of 9 tests. Some of them were skipped because they contain placeholder code.

**Visual Studio 2022**  
If you are using Visual Studio 2022, you can use the integrated Test Explorer.

If you do not have the Test Explorer showing, use the "Test" menu and choose "Test Explorer" (or use "Ctrl+E, T" as a keyboard shortcut).

In the Test Explorer, use the "Run All Tests In View" button (usually on the far right), or press use "Ctrl+R, V" as a keyboard shortcut.

*Note: your keyboard shortcuts may be different if you have third-party extensions installed (such as ReSharper).*

The Test Explorer should show a total of 9 tests. Some of them are marked as "Skipped" because they contain placeholder code.

Lab Goals
----------

We have three goals:

1. Update the existing tests to properly await the async methods.

2. Create a fake object that can be used for testing.

3. Write tests that use the fake object.

Current Classes
----------------
**DataProcessor.Library/DataParser**  
This is the class we want to test. This class parses a data file and logs errors using a separate logger class.

```c#
public async Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Person>> ParseData(IEnumerable<string> data)
{
    var processedRecords = new List<Person>();
    foreach (var record in data)
    {
        var fields = record.Split(',');
        if (fields.Length != 6)
        {
            await logger.LogMessage("Wrong number of fields in record", record)
                .ConfigureAwait(false);
            continue;
        }

        int id;
        if (!Int32.TryParse(fields[0], out id))
        {
            await logger.LogMessage("Cannot parse Id field", record)
                .ConfigureAwait(false);
            continue;
        }

        DateTime startDate;
        if (!DateTime.TryParse(fields[3], out startDate))
        {
            await logger.LogMessage("Cannot parse Start Date field", record)
                .ConfigureAwait(false);
            continue;
        }

        int rating;
        if (!Int32.TryParse(fields[4], out rating))
        {
            await logger.LogMessage("Cannot parse Rating field", record)
                .ConfigureAwait(false);
            continue;
        }

        var person = new Person(id, fields[1], fields[2], 
            startDate, rating, fields[5]);

        // Successfully parsed record
        processedRecords.Add(person);
    }
    return processedRecords;
}
```

The logger is injected through the constructor of the DataParser class.

```c#
public DataParser(ILogger logger)
{
    this.logger = logger ?? new NullLogger();
}
```

**DataProcessor.Library/ILogger**  
This is the interface for the logger. We will use this to create fake/mock objects for testing:

```c#
public interface ILogger
{
    Task LogMessage(string message, string data);
}
```

**DataProcessor.Library.Tests/TestData**  
This class contains hard-coded test data that can be used for testing.

**DataProcessor.Library.Tests/FakeLogger**  
This is a stub for our fake logging class.

```c#
public class FakeLogger // : ILogger
{

}
```

This will need to be filled in for testing.

**DataProcessor.Library.Tests/DataParserLoggerTests**  
This class contains tests to make sure the logger is called appropriately. 

Here is a sample test:

```c#
[TestMethod]
public void ParseData_WithBadRecord_LoggerIsCalledOnce()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockLogger = new Mock<ILogger>();
    var parser = new DataParser(mockLogger.Object);

    // Act
    parser.ParseData(TestData.BadRecord);

    // Assert
    mockLogger.Verify(m =>
        m.LogMessage(It.IsAny<string>(),
            TestData.BadRecord[0]),
            Times.Once());
}
```
This test is working, but it needs some fixing to make sure it stays that way.

**DataProcessor.Library.Tests/DataParserTests**  
This class contains tests to make sure that good records are returned and bad records are not. These tests have not been implemented.

Sample:

```c#
[TestMethod]
public void ParseData_WithMixedData_ReturnsGoodRecords()
{
    Assert.Inconclusive();
}
```

Hints
------
In DataParserLoggerTests.cs:  
* Update the tests so that they "await" the call to the ParseData method.

In FakeLogger.cs
* Implement the "ILogger" interface.
* This does not need to do anything, but you should avoid returning "null".

In DataParserTests.cs:
* Implement the unit tests based on the method name.
* When calling the "DataParser.ParseData" method, use the static fields in the "TestData" class. Example:
```c#
parser.ParseData(TestData.GoodRecord)
```
* For "Mixed" data, use the TestData.Data field.

If you want more assistance, step-by-step instructions are included below. Otherwise, if you'd like to challenge yourself, **STOP READING NOW**

Updating Existing Tests: Step-By-Step
-------------
1. The DataParserLoggerTests test class.

This class contains several existing tests that call an asynchronous method (ParseData). These tests do not wait for the asynchronous method to complete. While they do currently pass, this is primarily due to luck. If the ParseData method changes, the timing could change, and these tests would no longer pass.

It is best to make sure we await the asynchronous methods to ensure that they finish.

2. Review the first unit test.

```c#
[TestMethod]
public void ParseData_WithBadRecord_LoggerIsCalledOnce()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockLogger = new Mock<ILogger>();
    var parser = new DataParser(mockLogger.Object);

    // Act
    parser.ParseData(TestData.BadRecord);

    // Assert
    mockLogger.Verify(m =>
        m.LogMessage(It.IsAny<string>(),
            TestData.BadRecord[0]),
            Times.Once());
}
```

Let's do a walkthrough of what this test is doing before updating it.

This test calls the "ParseData" method with 1 bad record. We expect that the logger will be called 1 time for this. This test uses Moq (a mocking framework) to check the behavior.

In the Arrange section, a mock of "ILogger" is created using Moq (a mock is an in-memory implementation of the interface that we can use for testing). Then the "ILogger" part of the mock is passed to the DataParser class constructor.

In the Act section, we call the ParseData method.

In the Assert, we use the mock object's "Verify" method. In this case, we check to make sure that the "LogMessage" method on the logger is called one time (based on the "Times.Once()" parameter). And that one of the parameters is the bad record.

We won't go into the full details of the Moq framework. If you're interested, a quickstart is available here: [https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart).  

3. Update the first unit test.

Add "await" to the "ParseData" method call.

```c#
// Act
await parser.ParseData(TestData.BadRecord);
```

Change the signature of the test method from "void" to "async Task".

```c#
[TestMethod]
public async Task ParseData_WithBadRecord_LoggerIsCalledOnce()
```

Here's the completed test.

```c#
[TestMethod]
public async Task ParseData_WithBadRecord_LoggerIsCalledOnce()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockLogger = new Mock<ILogger>();
    var parser = new DataParser(mockLogger.Object);

    // Act
    await parser.ParseData(TestData.BadRecord);

    // Assert
    mockLogger.Verify(m =>
        m.LogMessage(It.IsAny<string>(), 
            TestData.BadRecord[0]),
            Times.Once());
}
```

4. Make the same updates to the other three tests.

Change the method signatures and "await" the ParseData method in the other three unit tests.

*Note: I won't put the completed code here, you can check the "Completed" folder of the lab for that.*  

5. Re-run the tests.

Re-run the unit tests from the command line or from the Visual Studio Test Explorer (as described at the beginning of the lab). This should show the same results as before.

These 4 tests still pass, but they are more resilient to changes to the code.

Creating a Fake Object with Asynchronous Methods: Step-By-Step
-------------
For the other unit tests, we will use a fake object (rather than a mock). As mentioned above, a mock is an in-memory implementation that can be use for testing; a fake is "real" implementation in our code that has fake or placeholder behavior. 

Depending in the code and testing scenario, sometimes mocks work well, and sometimes fake objects are preferred. So we will look at fakes here.

1. Review the FakeLogger class.

As shown above, the FakeLogger class is currently empty.

```c#
public class FakeLogger // : ILogger
{

}
```

2. Implement the logger interface.

Remove the comment to specify that FakeLogger implements the "ILogger" interface.

```c#
public class FakeLogger : ILogger
{

}
```

To implement the interface, click on "ILogger", then use "Ctrl+." in Visual Studio. This gives the option to "Implement interface". You can also use the Quick Actions lightbulb to get the same option.  

This gives us a placeholder for the interface method.

```c#
public class FakeLogger : ILogger
{
    public Task LogMessage(string message, string data)
    {
        throw new System.NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

3. Return a completed task.

We don't need this method to do anything. It is tempting to simply return "null" from this method.

```c#
public class FakeLogger : ILogger
{
    public Task LogMessage(string message, string data)
    {
        // AVOID THIS
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Caution**  
It's tempting to return "null" from this method, particularly since the logger intentionally does nothing. But this is a bad practice can cause issues for callers.

We could create a new Task with a TaskFactory, but a better solution is to use the static "CompletedTask" property on the Task type.

*Note: If you completed the first lab, then this should look familiar.*

```c#
public class FakeLogger : ILogger
{
    public Task LogMessage(string message, string data)
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

This completes the FakeLogger class.

A couple of questions:  
* Q: The "NullLogger" class in the library does the same thing. Isn't this duplicated code?  
A: While it is technically duplicated code, this logger belongs to the tests. It can change independently of whatever is in the library.

* Q: What if the async method needs to return a value?  
A: For this we can use the "FromResult" method on Task.

```c#
return Task.FromResult<string>("Test String");
```

Now that we have the fake object in place, we can test the ParseData method.

Writing Async Test Methods: Step-by-Step
-------------

1. Review the DataParserTests class.

The DataParserTests class contains 5 unit tests that have placeholder code.

```c#
[TestMethod]
public void ParseData_WithMixedData_ReturnsGoodRecords()
{
    Assert.Inconclusive();
}
```

2. Review the first test.

These tests use a 3 part naming scheme:  
* Unit under test
* State being tested
* Expected result

```c#
[TestMethod]
public void ParseData_WithMixedData_ReturnsGoodRecords()
{
    Assert.Inconclusive();
}
```

For this test the unit under test is the "ParseData" method. The state being tested is that the method is called with both good and bad records ("Mixed Data"). The expected result is that the good records are returned.

3. "Arrange" the first test.

We need an instance of the DataParser class to run tests against. So, we will create an instance of the FakeLogger class and pass it to the DataParser constructor.

```c#
// Arrange
var logger = new FakeLogger();
var parser = new DataParser(logger);
```

4. "Act" in the first test.

For the "Act" section, we will call the DataParser method with "TestData.Data" (this is test data set that contains both good and bad records).

Since the "DataParser" method is asynchronous, we will want to "await" it so that we can get the result back (a read-only collection of Person objects).

```c#
// Act
var records = await parser.ParseData(TestData.Data);
```

In addition, we need to update the signature of the test method from "void" to "async Task".

```c#
public async Task ParseData_WithMixedData_ReturnsGoodRecords()
```

5. "Assert" the results.

For this we will remove the "Assert.Inclusive" to change it to something more useful.  

In this case, the test data has 9 good records (mixed in wit 4 bad records). For simplicity, we will count the number of items returned.

```c#
// Assert
Assert.AreEqual(9, records.Count());
```

We could go into a deeper comparison, but this is what we need as an initial sanity check.

Here's the completed test:

```c#
[TestMethod]
public async Task ParseData_WithMixedData_ReturnsGoodRecords()
{
    // Arrange
    var logger = new FakeLogger();
    var parser = new DataParser(logger);

    // Act
    var records = await parser.ParseData(TestData.Data);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(9, records.Count());
}
```

6. Re-run the tests.

Re-run the unit tests. This time, you will see that one of the previously "skipped" tests is now passing.

7. Implement the second test.

The second test is called "ParseData_WithGoodRecord_ReturnsOneRecord". Based on our naming, if we call the "ParseData" method with one good record (using the "GoodRecord" in the test data), we should get 1 record returned (meaning it was parsed successfully).

The steps are similar to the first test. Here's the completed test:

```c#
[TestMethod]
public async Task ParseData_WithGoodRecord_ReturnsOneRecord()
{
    var logger = new FakeLogger();
    var parser = new DataParser(logger);

    var records = await parser.ParseData(TestData.GoodRecord);

    Assert.AreEqual(1, records.Count());
}
```

Re-run the test. This test should now pass.

8. Create a factory method.

Since the "Arrange" section is the same for both of these tests (and all of the following), I like to create factory methods to get me an object I can use for testing.  

In this case, a method called "GetParserWithFakeLogger" can give me a configured DataParser object.  

```c#
private DataParser GetParserWithFakeLogger()
{
    var logger = new FakeLogger();
    return new DataParser(logger);
}
```

*Note: If you want to get fancy, we can do this same thing as an expression:*

```c#
private DataParser GetParserWithFakeLogger() => new DataParser(new FakeLogger());
```

*Probably don't do this, but if you want to get really fancy, we can use the implicit "new" for the DataParser. (I don't recommend this since it makes things pretty hard to read.):*

```c#
private DataParser GetParserWithFakeLogger() => new(new FakeLogger());
```

Then the tests can be updated as follows:

```c#
[TestMethod]
public async Task ParseData_WithGoodRecord_ReturnsOneRecord()
{
    var parser = GetParserWithFakeLogger();

    var records = await parser.ParseData(TestData.GoodRecord);

    Assert.AreEqual(1, records.Count());
}
```

*Note: I prefer to use factory methods over setup methods in order to keep things obvious. Sometimes we lose track of what setup methods are doing. For more information, see this article: [Unit Testing: Setup Methods or Not?](https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2015/06/unit-testing-setup-methods-or-not.html)*

9. Update the other three tests.

The remaining tests are similar to the second test. The only difference is that they expect to have 0 records returned instead of 1 record.

*Note: I won't put the completed code here, you can check the "Completed" folder of the lab for that.*

10. Re-run the tests.

With all of the tests completed, there should now be 9 passing tests.  

```
Starting test execution, please wait...
A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.

Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     9, Skipped:     0, Total:     9, Duration: 85 ms - DataProcessor.Library.Tests.dll (net6.0)
```

Conclusion
-------------
So this has shown us how to write tests that call asynchronous methods and how to create fake objects that have asynchronous methods. These techniques can be extended to create mock objects that can be used for testing.
